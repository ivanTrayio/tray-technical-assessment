# Solutions Engineer Technical Test

A program that navigates an imaginary robotic hoover (much like a [Roomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba)) through an equally imaginary room based on:

* room dimensions (as X and Y coordinates)
* locations of patches of dirt as X and Y coordinates)
* an initial hoover position (as X and Y coordinates)
* driving instructions (as cardinal directions)
